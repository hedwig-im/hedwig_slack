# Hedwig Slack Adapter

> A Slack Adapter for [Hedwig](https://github.com/hedwig-im/hedwig)

## Getting started

Let's generate a new Elixir application with a supervision tree:

```
位 mix new alfred --sup
* creating README.md
* creating .gitignore
* creating mix.exs
* creating config
* creating config/config.exs
* creating lib
* creating lib/alfred.ex
* creating test
* creating test/test_helper.exs
* creating test/alfred_test.exs

Your Mix project was created successfully.
You can use "mix" to compile it, test it, and more:

    cd alfred
    mix test

Run "mix help" for more commands.
```

Change into our new application directory:

```
位 cd alfred
```

Add `hedwig_slack` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:hedwig_slack, "~> 0.1"}]
end
```

Ensure `hedwig_slack` is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:hedwig_slack]]
end
```

### Generate our robot

```
位 mix hedwig.gen.robot

Welcome to the Hedwig Robot Generator!

Let's get started.

What would you like to name your bot?: alfred

Available adapters

1. Hedwig.Adapters.Slack
2. Hedwig.Adapters.Console
3. Hedwig.Adapters.Test

Please select an adapter: 1

* creating lib/alfred
* creating lib/alfred/robot.ex
* updating config/config.exs

Don't forget to add your new robot to your supervision tree
(typically in lib/alfred.ex):

    worker(Alfred.Robot, [])
```

### Supervise our robot

We'll want Alfred to be supervised and started when we start our application.
Let's add it to our supervision tree. Open up `lib/alfred.ex` and add the
following to the `children` list:

```elixir
worker(Alfred.Robot, [])
```

### Configuration

The next thing we need to do is configure our bot for our XMPP server. Open up
`config/config.exs` and let's take a look at what was generated for us:

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :alfred, Alfred.Robot,
  adapter: Hedwig.Adapters.Slack,
  name: "alfred",
  aka: "/",
  responders: [
    {Hedwig.Responders.Help, []},
    {Hedwig.Responders.GreatSuccess, []},
    {Hedwig.Responders.ShipIt, []}
  ]
```

So we have the `adapter`, `name`, `aka`, and `responders` set. The `adapter` is
the module responsible for handling all of the Slack details like connecting and
sending and receiving messages over the network. The `name` is the name that our
bot will respond to. The `aka` (also known as) field is optional, but it allows
us to address our bot with an alias. By default, this alias is set to `/`.

Finally we have `responders`. Responders are modules that provide functions that
match on the messages that get sent to our bot. We'll discuss this further in
a bit.

We'll need to provide a few more things in order for us to connect to our Slack
server. We'll need to provide our bot's API key as well as a list of rooms we
want our bot to join once connected. Let's see what that looks like:

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :alfred, Alfred.Robot,
  adapter: Hedwig.Adapters.Slack,
  name: "alfred",
  aka: "/",
  # fill in the appropriate API token for your bot
  token: "some api token",
  # for now, you can invite your bot to a channel in slack and it will join
  # automatically
  rooms: [],
  responders: [
    {Hedwig.Responders.Help, []},
    {Hedwig.Responders.GreatSuccess, []},
    {Hedwig.Responders.ShipIt, []}
  ]
```

Great! We're ready to start our bot. From the root of our application, let's run
the following:

```
位 mix run --no-halt
```

This will start our application along with our bot. Our bot should connect to
Slack and join the rooms it's in based on its Slack integration. From there, we
can chat with our bot in any Slack client.

Since we have the `Help` responder installed, we can say `alfred help` and we
should see a list of usage for all of the installed responders.

## What's next?

Well, that's it for now. Make sure to read the [Hedwig Documentation](http://hexdocs.pm/hedwig) for more
details on writing responders and other exciting things!
